Extension available at: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-top-10-most-watched-tw/ijjhhldncdhjkpnohencpcdlhdjchjif

Compiles a top 10 of your most watched Twitch streamers and displays it into a graph.
Ever wondered which Twitch streamer you watch the most? What about a whole Top 10?!

It's really that simple; install the addon, sit back and enjoy some Twitch while the extension compiles your graph over time.

I don't collect any information regarding your watching habits as everything is stored locally in your browser.

I strongly suggest you pin the extension to be able to glance at your Top 10 at will.
